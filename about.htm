            <p>Game Backup Monitor is a simple, but flexible application that detects games as you play them. Once you finish playing a game, a backup of the saved games will be made automatically using 7-Zip compression. GBM can be used on a single computer, or on multiple computers to effectively add cloud support to any game or application.</p>
            <p>Game Backup Monitor was designed with gaming in mind, but it can be used to monitor any application on your PC!</p>
            <h3>Game Backup Monitor is completely free and open source software.</h3>
            <h4>Game Backup Monitor is currently only available in English.</h4>
