            <p>The main GBM window is mostly for information display, but has some important functions.</p>
            <p>The core portion of the window displays information about any game that has been detected, or information about a backup or restore operation currently being performed.</p>
            <p>A detailed log of all the actions GBM has performed in the current session is also displayed, this log can be hidden by resizing the window. If this log becomes too large over a session it will be auto-saved and cleared.</p><IMG class=manual alt="Main Screen" src  ="./GBM_files/manual_03.jpg" width=526 height=430 ><br>
            <p>The right side of the menu bar will show notifications(if enabled) about new saved games to restore. Clicking the notification will clear it for the current session and bring you directly to the Game Manager.</p>
            <p>The status bar shows what GBM is currently doing, as well as the monitor status.</p>
            <p>The monitor status button on the right can be used to control starting, stopping and cancelling game detection. This can also be accomplished with the File menu and system tray menu.</p>
            <p>The button on the left of the status bar indicates if GBM is running in normal mode (Blue User Icon) or as Administrator (Shield Icon). GBM can handle most situations running with normal mode, clicking this button lets you switch to Administrator quickly when it's required. This feature is not available when running in Linux.</p><IMG class=manual alt="Main Screen" src  ="./GBM_files/manual_12.jpg" width=526 height=286 ><br>
            <p>A "Cancel" button will appear on the main window during backup &amp; restore operations, clicking this will attempt to cancel the current operation. Please note that clicking Cancel may not have an immediate response, it can take some time before the operation reaches a point where it will be terminated.</p><IMG class=manual alt="Main Screen" src  ="./GBM_files/manual_04.jpg" width=526 height=247 ><br>
            <p>The "Cancel" button does NOT undo the operation, cancelling an operation may result in an unusable backup file or a corrupted save game. The "Cancel" button is intended for emergencies only, such as an incorrect configuration causing a lengthy backup of the wrong folder.</p>
            <p>This window can be closed and hidden to the system tray in Windows, or minimized to the taskbar in Linux.  All important menu options are available from the system tray menu.  The system tray icon and menu may not be available in Linux, depending on the desktop environment and Mono version used.</p>
