            <h3>Game Manager Quick Overview:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Add a new game to monitor by clicking the "+" (plus) 
  button below the list box. 
              <li>Delete a game by selecting the game(s) from the list 
  and clicking the the "-" (minus) button below the list box. 
              <li>Show all games by clicking the "All" option above the 
  list box. 
              <li>Show only games with backup data by clicking the 
  "Backups Only" option above the list box. This filter displays ALL games with 
  backup data. 
              <li>Show only games with new save data to restore by 
  clicking the "New Backups Pending" option above the list box. 
              <li>You can customize a list of games to display by 
  clicking the "Custom" option above the list box. 
              <li>Quickly find games by typing the name in the Quick 
  Filter. This filter is applied on top of any other filter you may be using. 
              <li>You can assign other programs to run each time one or 
  more games are detected by selecting them and clicking the "Link -&gt; 
  Process..." button. 
              <li>You can link game configurations together using the 
  "Link -&gt; Configuration" button. Linked configuations execute a backup or 
  restore each time the currently selected configuration is triggered. 
              <li>You can edit the Tags for one or more games by 
  selecting them and clicking the "Tags..." button. 
              <li>When available, "Launch Options" allows you to 
  configure how the currently selected game is launched or launch the game 
  itself. 
              <li>Restore an existing backup for a game by selecting 
  the game(s) from the list and clicking the "Restore" button. 
              <li>You can mark a game as restored without restoring the 
  data by selecting the game(s) from the list and clicking the "Mark as 
  Restored" button. 
              <li>You can backup immediately without playing a game by 
  selecting the game(s) from the list and click the "Backup" button. 
              <li>You can import an existing backup file for the 
  currently selected game using the "Import Backup Files" button. 
              <li>You can delete a backup file by selecting the game 
  from the list, choosing a specific backup and clicking the "Delete Backup" 
  button. You may also delete all backups for that specific game. 
              <li>You can locate the backup file or folder by selecting 
  the game and clicking the "Open Backup" button. 
              <li>You can view the restore location of the backup file 
  by selecting the game and clicking the "Open Restore Path" button. 
              <li>You can <a href="import.htm">import new game configurations</a> from the <a href="http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/GBM_Official.xml">official list</a> or an XML file using the Import button. 

              <li>You can export your game configurations to an XML file using the Export button.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Game Manager is a central hub for all important GBM functions. However, i'd highly recommend the "Add Game Wizard" to add new games to monitor until you become familiar with GBM.</p><IMG class=manual alt=Wizard src   ="./GBM_files/manual_07.jpg" width   =526 height=247 >
            <h3>Game Manager Detailed Overview:</h3>
            <p>The following is advanced information on each field used to configure a game.</p>
            <h3>Game Configuration</h3>
            <h4>Name:</h4>
            <p>The name of the game to monitor.  Multiple entries with the same name are allowed.</p>
            <h4>Game ID:</h4>
            <p>A unique identifier for the game, GBM will generate it automatically.  There is no need to manually set this unless you want to.</p>
            <p>If you share a backup folder with multiple PCs, changing a Game ID may cause data loss. See the <a href="syncing.htm">Automatic Syncing</a> section for more details.</p>
            <h4>Process:</h4>
            <p>The name of the game's executable file, without the extension. This IS case-sensitive, if entered incorrectly the game will not be detected.  Extensions will be automatically filtered off.</p>
            <p>If you don't know what to put here, check the game's "target" in the shortcut or game folder. Beware of games that use launchers, you do NOT want to monitor the launcher, you want to detect and monitor the game itself.</p>
            <p>Multiple entries with the same process are allowed, this is to handle games that use the same name for their executable.</p>
            <p>Games running in emulators, interpreters and virtual machines such as DOSBox and ScummVM are also supported. But must meet specific conditions to be detected: 
            </p><ol>
              <li>Each game uses it's own copy of the emulator software 
  in a unique location, major retailers such as GOG and Steam do this by 
  default. No special setup is required, you simply need to use the process name 
  of the emulator (Ex. DOSBox or scummvm). 
              <li>You may also set an appropriate value in the "Parameter" field so GBM can determine exactly which game is running. See the "Parameter" section below for more details.</li>
            </ol><p></p>
            <p>On Linux, games running in Wine are a special case.  Please see the <a href="faqlinux.htm">Linux FAQ</a> for more details.</p>
            <p>The process field is used by the game launcher as a default method of launching the game, this can be overridden in "Launch Options -&gt; Settings...".</p>
            <p>The process field can be left blank.  A configuration with an empty process field can only be triggered manually or by a configuration link.</p>            
            <h4>Regular Expression:</h4>
            <p>This indicates that the Process field is a Regular Expression.</p>
            <p>Regular Expressions allow GBM to match based on a pattern, so one configuration can detect multiple executables.</p>
            <p>For example, you want one configuration to detect both the 32-bit and 64-bit executables of a particular game.</p>
            <p>The Process field cannot be used to launch a game if it's a regular expression, use "Launch Options -&gt; Settings..." to select an alternate executable.</p>
            <h4>Parameter:</h4>
            <p>A command parameter value to match on when detecting the game.  This field is mainly used for detecting games running in emulator software, but also used as the default command parameters when launching a game from GBM.</p>
            <p>GBM will detect the "Process", then match the "Parameter" to any part of the full command.  This IS case-sensitive.</p>
            <p>As an example, lets use GOG's version of "An Elder Scroll Legend: Battlespire".</p>
            <p>The full command is: "C:\GOG Games\Battlespire\DOSBOX\DOSBox.exe" -conf "..\dosbox_battlespire.conf" -conf "..\dosbox_battlespire_single.conf" -noconsole -c exit</p>
            <p>We need to set the "Parameter" to something unique in the command, that no other game would be using.  "dosbox_battlespire.conf" or "dosbox_battlespire_single" would work.</p>
            <p>Please note that GBM cannot detect based on only the Parameter, the correct Process must also be used.</p>
            <p>It's highly recommended to use the full command so you can properly launch the game from GBM.  You can also set alternate launch parameters in "Launch Options -&gt; Settings".</p>
            <h4>Save Path:</h4>
            <p>The location of the save files for the game.</p>            
            <p>This path can be absolute, or relative to the game's executable.</p>
            <p>GBM will automatically determine absolute or relative path settings. If the save games are located in the game folder itself, you should always strive to use a path relative to the game's executable, this way your configuration will work on any PC regardless of where a game is installed.</p>
            <p>The path may also contain supported environment variables and/or <a href="customvariables.htm">custom path variables</a>.</p>
            <p>GBM supports the following environment variables.
            </p><ul>
              <li>%USERDOCUMENTS% (This variable is set and only used 
  by GBM at runtime.) 
              <li>%COMMONDOCUMENTS% (This variable is set and only used 
  by GBM at runtime.) 
              <li>%LOCALAPPDATA%" 
              <li>%APPDATA% 
              <li>%USERPROFILE% 
              <li>%PROGRAMDATA%</li>
            </ul><p></p>
            <p>GBM also supports the <A href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">XDG Base Directory Specification</A> while running in Linux.</p>
            <p>The path can also be certain Windows registry locations, please see the <a href="registry.htm">Windows registry</a> section of the manual for more details.</p>            
            <p>Most games don't tell you where they save. I highly recommend using <A href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/" target=_blank>PC Gaming Wiki</A> or searching common locations such as the game's installation folder, My Documents or AppData for the location of game saves.</p>
            <h4>Save Entire Folder:</h4>
            <p>This indicates if GBM should backup the entire folder indicated in the path. If you don't really know what files are important to be saving, just tick this box. Choosing this option will disable and clear any Include Items.</p>
            <h4>Save Multiple Backups:</h4>
            <p>This indicates if you want GBM to keep multiple backups for that game.  When using this option you can set a limit on the amount of backups to keep, any value from 0 to 100.  Set the limit to 0 if you'd like to keep an unlimited number of backups, this is the default.  When backups are limited, GBM will delete the oldest backup(s) automatically when new ones are made or if the limit is reduced.</p>
            <p>Expired backups are only deleted when a new backup for that particular game is made, not at the time a setting is changed.</p>
            <p>Expired backups are not deleted automatically if the "Save multiple backups" option is disabled after being used.</p>
            <p>All expired backups go to the Recycle Bin in Windows, but are permenantly deleted in Linux.</p>
            <h4>Delete Folder on Restore:</h4>
            <p>This indicates if you want GBM to delete the saved game folder prior to restoring a new backup.</p>
            <p>This option is used for games that change the file names of their saves, which results in a mix of old and new saved games if the old saves aren't deleted first.</p>
            <p>This option can only be used when "Save Entire Folder" is selected and no files are excluded.</p>
            <p>Deleted folders go to the Recycle Bin in Windows, but are permenantly deleted in Linux.</p>            
            <p>This option is not part of official configurations or import/export features.</p>
            <p>GBM checks for dangerous configurations in which this option should not be used and disables it, but even so use caution with this option.</p>
            <h4>Comments:</h4>
            <p>This is used to store any extra information about the configuration.</p>
            <h4>OS:</h4>
            <p>This is the target operating system of the configuration.  The OS field cannot be modified in Windows, this field allows Linux users to manage native and Windows games in the same list.
            </p><h4>Include and Exclude Items:</h4>
            <p>You can configure which file types, specific files or sub-folders should be included in or excluded from the backup using the Include / Exclude Builder.</p>
            <p>Click the Include Items... or Exclude Items.. button to launch the builder.</p>
            <p>A value in brackets on the button indicates the amount of items being included or excluded. If either button is <b>bold</b>, this indicates that there are changes that haven't been saved.</p><IMG class=manual alt=Builder src   ="./GBM_files/manual_14.jpg" width   =586 height=488 ><br>
            <p>The left side of the window (Saved Game Explorer) shows the current game's save folder in a Windows Explorer type view. If this area is blank it's because GBM couldn't determine the save folder or it doesn't currently exist.</p>
            <p>The right side of the window (Current Items) shows any items being included or excluded.</p>
            <p>You can add new items to include or exclude by ticking the check boxes beside any files or folders in the Saved Game Explorer, and using the right arrow button to move them into the Current Items list.</p>
            <p>When you choose a file to include or exclude, GBM will use the file type extension instead of the individual file name. You can toggle this behavior using the "Options" section under the Saved Game Explorer.</p>
            <p>You can remove any items you've added to the Current Items list by selecting them and using the left arrow button. You can also right-click items and use the "Remove" command.</p>
            <p>You can edit any items you've added by right-clicking them and choosing Edit. Advanced users may want to edit items and add wildcards to refine their configuration.</p>
            <p>You can add custom items by right-clicking on any blank part of the Current Items list and choosing "Add Custom Item"</p>
            <p>And finally if you prefer the old hardcore way of doing things, you can click "Raw Edit" and simply edit a colon delimited list of items.</p>
            <h4>Include/Exclude Option - Recurse sub-folders:</h4>
            <p>This option determines if GBM should scan every sub-folder of a save path when determining which files and folders to include or exclude from a backup.</p>
            <p>This option defaults to enabled and in most cases it does not need to be changed.</p>
            <p>However, it is highly recommended to disable this option when a backup configuration is saving files from an extremely large folder:
              </p><ul>
                <li>Recursively scanning a large folder can cause a 
  backup configuration to take minutes, when it should take less than a second. 
                <li>When this option is disabled, any items to be included or excluded from the backup need to directly referenced.  For example:
                  <ul>
                    <li>A game folder with many thousands of files, 
    contains a "Saved Games" sub-folder and "Campaign" sub-folder with files 
    using the .sav extension. 
                    <li>If "Recurse sub-folders" is disabled, the include 
    items would need to be "Saved Games\*.sav" and "Campaign\*.sav". This backup 
    would process almost instantly. 
                    <li>If "Recurse sub-folders" is enabled, an include item of simply "*.sav" would be sufficient, but this backup configuration could take minutes to complete.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Game Information</h3>
            <h4>Game Path:</h4>
            <p>This is the path to the game's executable file. In most cases GBM will auto-detect this information, but it can be set manually.</p>
            <p>This field may also contain same supported environment variables and <a href="customvariables.htm">custom path variables</a> as the Save Path field.</p>
            <p>The path is used to determine the save location for games with a relative save path. It is also used to properly detect games that share process names, like DOSBox and ScummVM games.</p>
            <p>This field is also used to determine the default location of the executable when launching a game from GBM.</p>
            <h4>Company:</h4>
            <p>You can manually set a company name to be displayed when the game is detected. This takes priority over the company information detected from the game's executable.</p>
            <h4>Version:</h4>
            <p>You can manually set a version value to be displayed when the game is detected. This takes priority over the version information detected from the game's executable.</p>
            <h4>Icon:</h4>
            <p>You can manually set a icon to be displayed when the game is detected. This takes priority over the icon used by the game's executable.</p>
            <h3>Link -&gt; Process:</h3>            
            <p>You can assign one or more programs to automatically run when a game is detected.  This could be useful to launch a custom control scheme or overlay whenever you play a particular game.</p><IMG class=manual alt=Processes src   ="./GBM_files/manual_21.jpg" width   =386 height=288 ><br>
            <p>You can manage (Create, Edit or Delete) any Processes you want to use from the Setup menu or inside the Game Manager.</p><IMG class=manual alt=Processes src   ="./GBM_files/manual_22.jpg" width   =586 height=288 ><br>            
            <p>Select the processes and use the appropriate buttons to add or remove them.</p>
            <h3>Link -&gt; Configuration:</h3>
            <p>You may chain game configuations together.  This is an advanced feature that allows one configuration to trigger the backup or restore of any other linked configuration(s).  This is useful for games that may keep saves or other important files in multiple unique locations.
            <br><br><IMG class=manual alt="Configuration Links" src  ="./GBM_files/manual_25.jpg" width   =486 height=388 >
            </p><ul>
              <li>Configurations are linked <b>one-way</b> by default. For example, Config #1 -&gt; 
  Config #2 means Config #1 will trigger Config #2, but Config #2 will not 
  trigger Config #1. 
              <li>You can setup two-way links if you wish, but you must 
  do this manually by also linking Config #2 -&gt; Config #1 using the example 
  above. 
              <li>Links continue in a chain. For example, Config #1 
  triggers Config #2, then Config #2 can trigger Config #3 and so on. 
              <li>Only one instance of a configuration can exist in the 
  same chain, if there are multiple links to the same configuration over a 
  single chain they are ignored. 
              <li>The XML import/export feature supports configuation 
  linking, however all the configurations in the chain must be imported for it 
  to work correctly. 
              <li>When restoring linked configurations that use the "Save Multiple Backups" option, only the latest backup of each configuration in the chain can be restored. If an older backup is selected, you may still proceed without restoring any linked configuration(s).</li>
            </ul><p></p>             
            <h3>Tags</h3>
            <p>You can use Tags to organize your game list. You can manage (Create, Edit or Delete) any Tags you want to use from the Setup menu or inside the Game Manager.</p><IMG class=manual alt=Tags src   ="./GBM_files/manual_13.jpg" width   =586 height=288 ><br>
            <p>Tags allow you to filter the games you want to view in the Game Manager or the configurations you may want to Export to an XML file.</p><IMG class=manual alt=Tags src   ="./GBM_files/manual_08.jpg" width   =386 height=288 ><br>
            <p>Select the tags and use the appropriate buttons to add or remove them.</p>
            <h4>Important notice regarding adding tags or processes to multiple games:</h4>
            <p>When you're modifying processes, tags or linked configurations for multiple games, the "Current" list shows every item used by each game you have selected, this doesn't mean those items are already applied to every game selected. If you'd like to apply an item to each selected game and it's already used, simply remove it then re-add it.</p>
            <h3>Monitor Settings</h3>
            <h4>Monitor this Game:</h4>
            <p>This box indicates that GBM will actively monitor for this game.</p>
            <h4>Monitor Only:</h4>
            <p>This box indicates that GBM will not trigger a backup when the game is closed.</p>
            <h3>Backup Information</h3>
            <h4>Backup Data:</h4>
            <p>This field lists all the available backup data.  You may select older entries if you need to restore or delete it.</p>
            <p>You may notice one or more entries automatically disappearing from this field when it's accessed.  This occurs when backup files for those entries have been manually deleted.
            </p><h4>Local Data:</h4>
            <p>This displays information about the last backup made or restored on the current computer.</p>
            <h4>Backup File:</h4>
            <p>This displays the backup file name and file size.</p>
            <h4>Restore Path:</h4>
            <p>This displays the location the backup file will restore to, this may be an absolute or relative path.</p>
            <h4>Import Backup Files:</h4>
            <p>GBM allows importing one or more 7-Zip backup files for the selected game.  This feature is useful if you lost your GBM database(s), but not the backup files.  It also can be used to easily move compatible saved game backups between Windows and Linux.
            </p><ul>
              <li>Importing a single backup file will attempt to 
  overwrite the current backup file if one exists. Enable "Save Multiple 
  Backups" if you don't want to overwrite the current backup. 
              <li>Importing multiple backup files requires "Save 
  Multple Backups" to be enabled . 
              <li>GBM will attempt to verify imported backup files and display warnings if a problem is detected.  However, you can still force GBM to import a backup file using this method.</li>
            </ul><p></p>
            <h4>Delete Backup:</h4>
            <p>This allows deleting the currently selected backup or all backups for the selected game.</p>
            <h4>Open Backup -&gt; File:</h4>
            <p>This opens the selected backup file in the default software associated with 7-Zip files.</p>
            <h4>Open Backup -&gt; Folder:</h4>
            <p>This opens the folder containing the selected backup file using the default folder browser.</p>
            <h4>Open Restore Path:</h4>
            <p>This automatically opens the backup's restore path in the default file browser software.</p>
