          <div class="pageSectionContent">
            <p>When using the Game Manager or exporting your game list to an XML file, you'll have the option to use a custom filter.</p>
            <p>You can choose to filter by Game Information and by Tag.</p>
            <h4>Game Information</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Choose an available field to filter on, depending on 
  the field you will have different filter options. 
              <li>Click the "Not" checkbox if you'd like to reverse the 
  filter. 
              <li>Click the "Add" button to add the filter to the list. 
  You can add as many as you wish. 
              <li>To delete a filter, select it from the list and click 
  "Remove". 
              <li>Select a Filter Type.
                <ul>
                  <li>"Any" - Games that match ANY of the filters will be 
    included in the results. 
                  <li>"All" - Only games that match ALL of the filters will be included in the results.</li>                  
                </ul>
              <li>GBM always uses a case-insensitive partial search to 
  match on text fields. 
              <li>Due to the way GBM stores data, certain fields may give unpredictable results when used in a filter.  These fields are marked with an asterisk.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Tag</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Choose the Tags you want to filter by or exclude and 
  use the appropriate buttons to add or remove them. 
              <li>There are different options available when filtering by tag:
                <ul>
                  <li>Any Tag - This will include games using ANY of the tags you have chosen to filter by.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Example: You have two games tagged as #Official, one game is also tagged as #GOG and the other is also tagged as #Steam. If you filter by "Any Tag" and choose #Official and #GOG, both games will be included since both included #Official.</li>
                    </ul>
                  <li>All Tags - This will only include games using ALL of the tags you have chosen to filter by.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Example: Using the same example games above, if you filter by "All Tags" and choose #Official and #GOG only one game will be shown, since only one game included both the #Official and #GOG tag.</li>
                    </ul>
                  <li>Note: These options have no effect on excluding tags.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>If you choose to filter by Tag but choose no tags to filter by, GBM will assume that means all games with no tags.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Sorting</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The filter results can be sorted by any of the available fields in ascending or descending order.</li>
            </ul>
