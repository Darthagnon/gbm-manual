            <p>This screen allows you to add an unlimited number of custom path variables to use in the configuration of your games.</p><IMG class=manual alt="Custom Path Variables" src ="./GBM_files/manual_09.jpg" width   =586 height=288 ><br>
            <p>Some games store their save files in locations that can be slightly different on each computer, this feature allows you to account for that and share configurations between any computer.</p>
            <h4>Name:</h4>
            <p>This is the name of the variable.  It cannot contain the % character, which will be stripped upon saving.</p>
            <h4>Path:</h4>
            <p>This is the local path the variable refers to.</p>
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>Many games designed for Steam use the "userdata" sub-folder in the Steam folder as a common saved game location.  But since Steam can be installed in a variety of locations, as well as each user having a different ID folder, every computer and user will store their saved games in a different location.</p>
            <p>We can create a custom path variable for this location, such as "Steam User Data" and point it to the location that changes.  Once we do this, any application configured to use that folder will use the variable instead and any another computer using that configuration simply has to setup the same variable and point it to the proper folder on their computer.</p>
            <h4>Notes:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Custom Path Variables can be used in the "Save Path" 
  and "Game Path" fields of a configuration. 
              <li>Multiple custom path variables can be used in the 
  same path, they can also be combined with a Windows environment variable. 
              <li>On the Game Manager, custom path variables will be 
  displayed similar to a Windows environment variable, such as %Variable Name%. 
  You can change this behavior in "Settings" by using the "Show resolved save 
  paths in Game Manager" option.              
              <li>After a Custom Path Variable is added, modified or 
  deleted any affected configurations will be updated automatically. 
              <li>To avoid issues, never manually use a Custom Path Variable in a configuration path before the variable has been created.
                <ul> 
                  <li>If you do this, open and make a small change, then save any affected configuration in the Game Manager to fix any problems.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>This is an advanced feature and can be completely ignored by most users, the official pre-configured list will never contain games that use a custom path variable.</li>
            </ul>
