            <p>GBM will sync some data between computers that share the same backup folder.</p>
            <p>All computers are synced to a single master list stored in the backup folder.</p>
            <p>This allows all computers with GBM to use the same game list.</p>
            <h4>When does GBM sync data?</h4>
            <ul>                            
              <li>A sync from master to local occurs when GBM is 
  loaded, and any time GBM detects another application has changed the master 
  list. 
              <li>A sync from local to the master occurs when any applicable data has been added or updated.</li>              
            </ul>
            <h4>What data is synced?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Game Configurations 
              <li>Game Configuration Links 
              <li>Tags</li>              
            </ul>
            <h4>What data is not synced?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Sessions 
              <li>Processes              
              <li>Launchers 
              <li>Launch Settings              
              <li>Wine Configuration (Linux Only)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>What happens when I delete a game configuration?</h4>
            <p>It will be deleted from all PCs that share the same backup folder.  Any associated extra data, such as sessions will also be removed.</p>
            <h4>Are there any other issues with syncing?</h4>
            <p>If the ID of a game is changed, either via the "Game Manager" or the "Sync Game IDs" tool, it has the same effect as deleting and re-adding it.</p>
            <p>This means other PCs sharing the backup folder will delete extra data associated with any game that has their ID changed.</p>
            <p>This does NOT affect the PC that actually makes the ID change.</p>
