            <p>Importing game configurations is done from the <a href="gamemanager.htm">Game Manager</a>.</p>
            <p>You can import pre-made backup configurations from the <a href="http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/GBM_Official.xml">official list</a> or an XML file exported from GBM.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The import window detects saved games currently on 
  your PC and will automatically select valid configurations by default. You can 
  run this process again using the "Detect Saved Games" button. 
              <li>The import window only shows new or updated 
  configurations, it will not display games you've already configured. If you're 
  seeing games you've already configured, then your Game IDs do not match the 
  official list. Please see "Sync Game IDs" in the "Tools" section later on in 
  the manual.              
              <li>New configurations are indicated with a plus icon, 
  updated configurations are indicated with an arrow icon. 
              <li>You can toggle selecting and de-selecting all 
  available configurations by clicking the "Select All" checkbox. 
              <li>You can search for specific games or by tag using the 
  "Filter" field. The filter is applied as you type, remove all text from the 
  field to clear the filter. 
              <li>You can display only currently selected 
  configurations using the "Show Only Selected" checkbox. This can be combined 
  with the "Filter" field. 
              <li>The bottom of the import window shows how many 
  configurations you have selected and how many are currently displayed. 
              <li>GBM remembers all configurations you've selected, even if they are not displayed by your current filter.</li>
