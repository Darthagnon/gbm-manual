            <h4>Compact Databases</h4>
            <p>This is used to rebuild GBM's databases to use an optimal amount of disk space. It should only be used when databases are reaching a noticably large size.</p>
            <h4>Import Backup -&gt; Files/Folder</h4>
            <p>This allows you to import GBM backup files or folders.
            </p><ul>
              <li>Only 7-Zip backup archives containing 
  metadata(_gbm_backup_metadata.xml) are supported by this feature. This is any 
  backup file created by GBM v1.2.0 or later. 
              <li>You may force the import of older or other backup 
  archives using the "Import Backup Files" feature in the Game Manager.              
              <li>When the backup configuration for an imported file 
  doesn't exist, it will be created based on the metadata in the file. 
              <li>When the backup configuration for an imported file 
  exists but doesn't match the metadata, it will be updated to match the 
  metadata in the file. 
              <li>If a backup file already exists, it will be overwritten by the imported file without prompt unless the configuration is using the "Save Multiple Backups" option.</li>
            </ul><p></p>
            <h4>Log -&gt; Clear</h4>
            <p>This is used to clear the current session log.</p>
            <h4>Log -&gt; Save</h4>
            <p>This is used to save the current session log to a text file.</p>
            <h4>Session Viewer</h4>            
            <p>The Session Viewer allows you to view all session data that has been recorded on the current PC.</p>
            <p>This option is only visible when "Enable Session Tracking" is checked in Settings.</p>
            <IMG class=manual alt=Tools src   ="./GBM_files/manual_19.jpg" width   =786 height=593 ><br>
            <p>The viewer can be filtered by game name or date.</p>
            <p>The date filter includes sessions that started AND ended in the desired range.</p>
            <p>You may delete one or more sessions by selecting them and using the "Delete Session" button.</p>
            <p><b>Important Note:</b> Deleting a game configuration from the Game Manager will also delete all session data for that game.</p>
            <p>You may export the data currently displayed on the grid by clicking the "Export Grid" button.</p>
            <IMG class=manual alt=Tools src   ="./GBM_files/manual_20.jpg" width   =286 height=293 ><br>            
            <p>You may choose between CSV (Comma Seperated Values) and XML formats.</p>
            <p>You may choose to export dates using the Unix timestamp format or your current locale settings.</p>
            <p>The CSV format can be exported with or without headers.</p>
            <h4>Sync Game IDs</h4>
            <p>GBM uses the game ID to determine which game configurations you already have when importing game configurations from the official list or an XML file.  If these IDs do not match, all configurations will be seen as "New".</p>
            <p>To solve this problem you can sync your Game IDs with the official list or an export file using this tool.  This tool is not 100% effective and some games will be missed if their names have changed substantially.</p>
            <p>This tool is mainly for upgrading configurations from old versions of GBM so they will be recognized by the official import.</p>                                  
            <p><b>Important:</b> If you share a backup folder with multiple PCs, using this feature may cause data loss.  Read the <a href="syncing.htm">Automatic Syncing</a> section for more details.</p>
